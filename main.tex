\chapter{\textit{N}=2 Multiplets and Lagrangians}
   This chapter is following\cite{Yuji2013N}.The aim is to 
   construct the Lagrangian with \textit{N} = 2 supersymmetry.
\section{Microscopic Lagrangian}
\subsection{\textit{N} =1 Superfield}
   It is convenient to use \textit{N} = 1 superfields to describe 
   \textit{N} = 2 systems. So for this purpose let us first review 
   the \textit{N} = 1 formalism.

   An \textit{N} = 1 vector multiplet consists of a Weyl fermion 
   ${\la}_{\a}$ and a vector field $A_{\m}$ both in the adjoint 
   representation of the gauge group $G$.
   \footnote{A field $X$ is in the representation of the gauge 
      group means that the covariant derivative of $X$ can be written as
      \begin{align*}
        D_{\m} X = 
        \partial_{\mu}{X}+ig[X,A_\m]
      \end{align*}
   }
   We combine them into the superfield $W_\alpha$ with the expansion
   \begin{equation}
      W_{\a} = 
      \la_{\a} + F_{(\a\be)}\tht^{\be}+ D\theta_\a+ \cdots
   \end{equation}
   Where D is an auxiliary field in the adjoint of the gauge group.
   $F_{\a \be} = \frac{i}{2} \sima{\m}{\be}{\dot\g} \simabar{\n}{\dot\g}{\a} F_{\m\n}$ is the anti-self-dual part of the field strength $F_{\m\n}$.
   
   The kinetic term for a vector multiplet is given by
   \begin{align}
      \int \dd^2{\tht}\frac{-i}{8\pi}\tau \text{tr} W_{\a}W^{\a}+ cc.
   \end{align}
   Where 
   \begin{align}
   \tau = 
   \frac{4\pi i }{g^2} + \frac{\theta}{2\pi}
   \end{align}
   Expand in components, we have
   \begin{align}
   \frac{1}{2g^2}\text{tr}F_{\m\n}F^{\m\n}
   +\frac{\tht}{16\pi^2}\text{tr}F_{\m\n}\twF^{\m\n} 
   + \frac{1}{g^2}\text{tr}D^2
   -\frac{2i}{g^2}\text{tr}\bar{\la}\fy[\partial]\la
   \end{align}
   We use the convention that $\text{tr}T^aT^b = \half\de^{ab}$
